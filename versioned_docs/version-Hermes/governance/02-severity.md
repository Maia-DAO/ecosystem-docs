# Severity Levels & Implications

### Severity 1

Proposals at this level represent the least severe category within the five-tier system. They are intended for minor adjustments that do not directly affect user funds. An example includes adding or removing gauges, which does not pose any significant risk to the platform.

- **Voting Threshold:** 0.1% to 1% of GovToken supply, currently set at 0.1%
- **Quorum Requirement:** 1% of GovToken supply
- **Voting Period:** 24 hours to 1 week, currently set at 3 days

### Severity 2

Proposals under this category are of moderate severity. They are suitable for changes that exert a slightly more substantial influence on the platform, such as the addition or removal of partners or partner vaults. Note that these changes may lead to the loss of unclaimed rewards.

- **Voting Threshold:** 0.25% to 2.5% of GovToken supply, currently set at 0.25%
- **Quorum Requirement:** 2% of GovToken supply
- **Voting Period:** 2 days to 1 week, currently set at 1 week

### Severity 3

This level addresses proposals involving architectural modifications that could temporarily affect system utilization. These proposals are more severe, often impacting the gauge system significantly, such as its addition or removal.

- **Voting Threshold:** 0.5% to 5% of GovToken supply, currently set at 0.5%
- **Quorum Requirement:** 4% of GovToken supply
- **Voting Period:** 1 week to 3 weeks, currently set at 2 weeks

### Severity 4

Level 4 proposals are critical and necessitate a higher engagement from the community. These include significant changes like adding Ulysses to a new chain.

**Voting Threshold:** 0.75% to 7.5% of GovToken supply, currently set at 0.75%
**Quorum Requirement:** 8% of GovToken supply
**Voting Period:** 2 weeks to 4 weeks, currently set at 3 weeks

### Severity 5

The most severe proposals fall under this category. They encompass major decisions affecting the platform or the protocol's token supply, such as updating the utility tokens' admin.

**Quorum Requirement:** 16% of GovToken supply
**Voting Period:** 2 weeks to 6 weeks, currently set at 5 weeks

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the severity level categorization is a crucial aspect of the platform's proposal voting system. Each level has unique characteristics and requirements, designed to ensure that proposals are given the appropriate level of scrutiny and their impact on the platform is thoroughly evaluated. It is essential to carefully consider the severity level when proposing changes to the platform.
