# Governance Process

To understand the governance process for Maia DAO Ecosystem, imagine a hypothetical project `Protocol XYZ` seeking approval to incorporate a gauge for their token `$XYZ`. This action is synonymous with '**whitelisting a token**' or '**adding a gauge** to their Liquidity Pool (LP)'.

In order for `Protocol XYZ` to whitelist their token `$XYZ`, it will require approval from bHERMES with majority voting in favor to add a new gauge. This ensures that $HERMES emissions are distributed exclusively to Liquidity Pools which have garnered consensus approval from bHERMES (aka 'Stakeholders' or 'Voters and in V2 could be referred to as 'Burners' -- all refers to the same participant who holds the bHERMES token).

# 3 Phases

The governance process has three phases. The first phase is a basic rough draft which signifies to the community that something is coming and thus prompts the community to begin discussing the potential changes and implications. 

- Phase 1: [Request for Comment][phase-1]

- Phase 2: [Temperature Check][phase-2]

- Phase 3: [Governance Proposal][phase-3]

Phase 2 involves a preliminary off-chain vote which is then followed by Phase 3, the on-chain governance proposal and vote to seal the deal. The following section will clearly define the objective, requirements, and a step-by-step guide to complete each phase. 

In general, for a proposal such as "Adding a Gauge" to go through this entire process, it should take anywhere from 1 to 2 weeks. Proposals with a higher severity category may take more than 2 weeks. 

> Note: For all governance proposals prior to V2 launch, only Phase 1 and Phase 2 will be required because of the limitations of the current governance system in place. The current governance process involves only a **Commonwealth Proposal (Phase 1)** followed by a **Snapshot Vote (Phase 2)**. This should also help our community and our potential partner's and their communities to also better position themselves prior to V2 launch.
