title: Migration Incentives
---

From August 14th to August 21st, join us for Migration Week! During this period, users can claim their migrated balances on Arbitrum. Additionally, POL has been added to the UniswapV3 MAIA/WETH pool, and all functionalities related to bridging, swapping, liquidity provision, Hermes burning, and Maia staking are available through the UI.

To support liquidity during this transition, weâ€™ll be distributing retroactive liquidity incentives at the end of the week. These incentives will be allocated proportionally based on the active liquidity provided, following the model of our Uniswap V3 Staker.

Starting August 21st, the full system will be online, allowing you to vote, stake, and boost UniswapV3 NFT positions in exchange for Hermes rewards.

## Reward Calculations

The rewards will be distributed according to our improved Uniswap V3 Staker version, modified from the original that was based on a Paradigm research about [Liquidity Mining on Uniswap V3](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/05/liquidity-mining-on-uniswap-v3). This makes the first week retroactive incentives work like the original Uniswap V3 Staker as there will be no minimum width and no boosted emissions from bHermes Boost Utility Token.

To avoid the gaming of rewards by adding very little liquidity to unused pools, the minimum TVL for rewards calculation for each pool is 100k USD. This means that if a pool has less than 100k USD, it will not distribute all of it's rewards for that period. For example, if there is only 10k liquidity in a pool it will only receive 10% of the rewards for that duration.

## Launch Initial Gauges

We are excited to announce the launch of our initial liquidity gauges, designed to kickstart the HermesV2 ecosystem and reward active participants. Below is a list of the available pools and the corresponding bootstrap incentive amounts in $HERMES.
