Welcome to Hermes Protocol üëã

Hermes Protocol is a decentralized, permissionless, omnichain yield and liquidity marketplace. V2 is an extensively audited upgrade, rebuilt from the ground up with enhanced features, improved mechanics, and a focus on community ownership and sustainability.

Introducing new mechanics like [b(3,3)](../Hermes/overview/tokenomics/bhermes#burning), Hermes V2 addresses limitations of existing DeFi protocols while enhancing user experience across the ecosystem.

## üîë Key Features

### Omnichain Concentrated and Unified Liquidity

One of the key features of Hermes Protocol V2 is the ability to swap from and to any chain, using concentrated and unified liquidity. This allows users to easily move between different chains and capitalize on the unique features and opportunities offered by each. Users can also provide liquidity across multiple chains, reinforcing Hermes as a true omnichain liquidity marketplace.

### Renting liquidity

Hermes V2 introduces a Liquidity Provision Assistant ‚Äî [Talos](../Talos/introduction) ‚Äî simplifying the process of providing liquidity and earning rewards. The protocol also includes a fully decentralized bribe system, allowing users to rent liquidity efficiently.

### Yield Marketplace

The final major feature of Hermes Protocol V2 is the Yield Marketplace, where users choose which yield opportunities to gain exposure to. This allows for flexible and efficient earnings, as voters allocate Hermes emissions based on their yield expectations without direct yield trading.

## ‚ùì Why Hermes?

### Capital-Efficient Active Liquidity Rental

Hermes Gauges reward active liquidity provision enhancing capital efficiency. A minimum range parameter is enforced to ensure fair reward distribution. This setup improves bribe efficiency and empowers liquidity providers with greater control over liquidity structures.

### Single Asset Exposure

Our liquidity structure leverages stable pools pairing the same asset across different networks. This significantly mitigates impermanent loss risk, making liquidity provision more predictable.

### Unified Omnichain Liquidity Hub

We aggregate liquidity from various blockchains into a single Omnichain Environment on Arbitrum, establishing a pioneering unified liquidity rental system. This system captures volume from cross-chain activities, including swaps and rebalancing for filling operations.

### Designed for a Chain-Abstracted Future

The system is optimized for integration with intent-based frameworks, functioning as a central hub on Arbitrum where fillers can rebalance efficiently.

### Support for Versatile Liquidity Architectures

A single concentrated liquidity gauge can aggregate liquidity from multiple networks using Wrapped Balancer Composable Stable Pool Tokens under the hood.

### Set and Forget Vote Mechanism

bHermes operates under the ERC4626 standard, automatically accruing rebases, which eliminates the need for weekly vote maintenance seen in traditional ve(3,3) models.

### Modular Approach

Initially supporting Uniswap and Balancer on Arbitrum, Hermes is evolving into a chain-agnostic, intent-driven liquidity framework.

### Ecosystem of Utility

We offer open-source tools as public goods:

- [Maia](../introduction): Streamlines your bHermes experience.
- [TALOS LPs](../Talos/introduction): Create pool-together Uniswap V3 strategies.
- [Ulysses](../Ulysses/introduction): Build custom cross-chain systems via our omnichain execution and liquidity layer built on Layer Zero.
