## **Introducing the Opening Ceremony**  

The **Opening Ceremony** is a strategic initiative designed to engage DeFi industry leaders and integrate their communities into the **Maia DAO Ecosystem**. This event lowers the entry barrier for protocols by granting them voting power and immediate access to liquidity rental, enabling them to grow within the ecosystem.  

To ensure optimal distribution of resources, the **Opening Ceremony** will unfold across multiple rounds. This structured approach ensures that participating protocols receive the necessary support to thrive.  

### **Timeline & Gauge Visibility**  

The first protocols will receive their **Opening Ceremony pledges**, and their **gauges will become visible** in the voting UI starting from the epoch that begins on **Thursday, November 7th, at 00:00 UTC**. At this point, community members will be able to vote on these gauges, actively participating in the allocation of **Hermes rewards** in exchange for generated fees and accumulated bribes.  

The **Opening Ceremony** will consist of three rounds:  

- **Round 1:** November 7th at 00:00 UTC  
- **Round 2:** November 21st at 00:00 UTC  
- **Round 3:** December 5th at 00:00 UTC

## **Introducing the Hermes Games**  

The **Hermes Games** is a **gamified partner program**, launched on **December 5th 2024**, designed to drive engagement and incentivize ecosystem participation. By completing key actions that benefit the protocol, participants earn rewards and recognition within the ecosystem.  

Participation is structured into different categories called **Sports**, each representing a unique way to contribute. These include [accumulating tokens](https://common.xyz/hermes-omnichain/discussion/14302-hip13-sport-specification-proposal-accumulating), [bribing gauges](https://common.xyz/hermes-omnichain/discussion/14193-hip12-sport-specification-proposal-bribing), [building tooling](https://common.xyz/hermes-omnichain/discussion/15413-hip17-sport-specification-proposal-tooling), and [creating integrations](https://common.xyz/hermes-omnichain/discussion/14398-hip16-sport-specification-proposal-integration). Unlike the Opening Ceremony, which follows a structured timeline, the **Hermes Games is open-ended**, allowing for continuous participation and innovation.  

With this initiative, the Maia DAO Ecosystem fosters a dynamic and engaged community, rewarding those who actively contribute to its growth.
