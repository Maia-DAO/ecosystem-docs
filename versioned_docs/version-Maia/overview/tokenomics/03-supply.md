The Maian ecosystem has undergone several phases in its development, each with its own unique goals and objectives.

## 1. Launch Phase
At launch, an event that lasted 24h, a total of 2712 MAIA tokens were minted and locked for 10 days until January 14th 2022. The primary goal of this phase was to reach the liquidity requirements for the platform and ensure a sustainable start to its operations.

## 2. Initial Distribution / Bootstrap Phase
The initial distribution/bootstrap phase was the second phase of the Maian ecosystem and lasted until August 2022. During this phase, the focus was on promoting a fair distribution of supply until MAIA reached its V1 supply cap at a total supply of 180k. This was achieved through a variety of farming strategies that aimed to protect and grow the backing of the platform. The idea behind this phase was to ensure that the supply of MAIA was distributed in a fair and equitable manner, providing an opportunity for a wide range of participants to get involved in the platforms revenue sharing model and decision making procedures

## 3. Dividends / Real Yield Phase
This phase constitutes the V2 iteration of the Maian Ecosystem where the key difference is the pivot from an emissions-based rewards system to a Decentralized Strategy Vault Platform (Yield Aggregator). This change aims to provide 'Real Yield' which is distributed from a share of treasury revenue to MAIA lockers as dividends.

During this phase, the platform focuses on three main participants:
- [Vaults](../vaults/strategies) Liquidity Providers
- [vMAIA](./vMaia) Lockers
- [Hermes](/protocols/Hermes/introduction) Bribers

The liquidity providers deposit their assets into the vaults and earn yield on their deposited assets, the vMAIA Lockers lock their MAIA tokens and earn dividends from the platform's revenue, and the Hermes Bribers, protocols that are looking to rent liquidity in Hermes Protocol.

Overall, the Maian ecosystem is designed to be sustainable in the long term by continuously evolving and adapting to the needs of the community and the market, while providing real yield to its participants.

### Bonds

In this phase, new bonds can only be emitted after the approval of proposals that thoroughly assess the true extent of the value added to the DAO. This approach aims to ensure that the supply expansion aligns with the value brought to the platforms stakeholders by new partners, protocols, or individuals. We're confident that without a clear vision of that value addition, the DAO will self-regulate its dialogue in a way that weeds off subpar suggestions.
