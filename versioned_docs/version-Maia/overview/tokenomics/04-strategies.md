### Overview

This initiative empowers **Hermes Partners** with the tools to create custom strategies, enabling tailored solutions for diversifying revenue, optimizing liquidity, and delegating utility tokens.

Launching in **Q1 2025**, this program will initially feature **Maia Boosted Strategies**, a new product from Maia DAO's flagship bHermes aggregator.

### How Do Maia Boosted Strategies Work?

These strategies leverage Maia DAO's accumulated boosting power to provide enhanced rewards for liquidity providers. As part of this system, a portion of Hermes rewards is captured as a fee, which is subsequently burned and added to vMAIA. This process ensures a steady increase in the bHermes balance controlled by each vMAIA holder. By consistently capturing Hermes emissions, Maia establishes a sustainable mechanism for ongoing value accrual to staked MAIA tokens while benefiting the broader ecosystem.

### Benefits of Partner Boosted Strategies

- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Partners can create their own customized solutions using the same foundational building blocks as Maia Boosted Strategies.
- **Liquidity Scaling**: Facilitates large-scale liquidity adoption across the ecosystem.
- **Increased Efficiency**: Boosts the utility and value proposition of protocols by integrating with Maia's infrastructure.
