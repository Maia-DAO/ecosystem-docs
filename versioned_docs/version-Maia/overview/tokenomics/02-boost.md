## How does vMAIA boost yields?

One of the core incentives for vMAIA adoption is the ability to maximize your bHERMES voting power and boost your rewards on deployed capital. But where does this boost come from? This is possible due to the fact Maia DAO has around 50% of the bHermes supply, as such, for each MAIA in circulation there is a basket of bHERMES in the Maian Treasury. [**Learn about boosting **](/protocols/Hermes/overview/tokenomics/utility-tokens/bhermes-boost) and [**how it is applied to gauges.**](/protocols/Hermes/overview/gauges/uni-v3#calculating-boost)

## Boosting Rewards

Maia's boosting rewards will be distributed to vMAIA, which is a virtual representation of staked MAIA, inversely proportional to how much vMAIA is staked. This means that the more vMAIA is staked, the fewer rewards will go to vMAIA. Conversely, the less vMAIA is staked, the more rewards will go to vMAIA.
For example, if 100% of MAIA is staked as vMAIA, 0% of rewards will go to vMAIA, as all MAIA is already staked. If 0% of MAIA is staked, 100% of rewards will go to vMAIA, as no MAIA is currently staked. The rest of the rewards will be kept by the DAO
This mechanism is designed to encourage users to stake their vMAIA, which in turn will increase liquidity and stability of the system. It also allows the DAO to gather some rewards to be used for protocol development and maintenance.

## Strategy Vaults Boosting

[**Decentralized Strategy Vaults **](../vaults/strategies#hermes-synergy) will be composed of Boost Aggregators at their core and can be modularly attached to any underlying strategy over which MAIA has boost, this can be a staked TALOS position or a HERMES gauge.
