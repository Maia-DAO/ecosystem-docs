# Phase 1: Request for Comment

### **Objective**
The purpose of the first phase of the governance process is meant to allow the community to digest a proposal, comment, and ask questions about the new partner in question and how it will benefit the ecosystem.

### **Requirements**
- Duration: Minimum of 3 Days
- Quorum: N/A
- Method: Governance post on [Commmonwealth Forum](https://commonwealth.im/maia-dao/discussions) 

### **How to Create Phase 1 Request for Comment**

1. In their proposal, the partner should clearly specify the desired tier they are applying for and provide detailed, verifiable information on how they plan to meet the associated requirements. 

2. They must also outline a transparent framework that allows any community member to easily track and evaluate their progress towards achieving the milestones set by the partner. This framework should include measurable objectives and verifiable data sources.

3. To post a RFC, label your post “[MIP-NUMBER] RFC - [Your Title Here]”. Prior to moving to Phase 2, give the community **at least 3 days** to read and comment on the RFC. Please respond to questions in the comments, and take feedback into account in the next iteration of the proposal posted in Phase 2.
