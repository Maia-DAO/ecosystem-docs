Welcome to Maia DAO 👋

Maia is the **yield powerhouse of DeFi**, designed to streamline your BurntHermes experience, enhance yield opportunities, and drive ecosystem sustainability.

## 🌍 The Maia Ecosystem

Maia was fairly launched via bonds and is fully community-owned. As a comprehensive DeFi hub, it offers a suite of financial instruments that optimize yield and liquidity.

The ecosystem currently includes:

- **Maia** - Yield Powerhouse.
- [**Hermes**](./Hermes/introduction) - Omnichain AMM and YLM (Yield and Liquidity Marketplace).
- [**TALOS**](./Talos/introduction) - Transparent Automated Liquidity Omnichain Strategies.
- [**Ulysses**](./Ulysses/introduction) - Omnichain Liquidity and Interoperability Protocol.

## 🔑 Key Features

### Boosted Yield Strategies

Playing a central role in the Maia Ecosystem, Maia holds significant control over bHermes and provides a framework for [Boosted Yield Strategies](./overview/tokenomics/04-strategies.md), optimizing returns across the ecosystem.

### Maia Staking

When staked as [vMAIA](./overview/tokenomics/vMaia), $MAIA serves as both a **utility and governance token**, driving key coordination mechanisms across the ecosystem.

#### Voting Power

Control a share of Maia DAO's Voting Power, influence gauge allocations and governance decisions.

#### Bribe Rewards

Earn bribes based on your voting power allocations.

### Ever-Increasing Utility Ratio

Each [vMAIA](./overview/tokenomics/vMaia) token grants you gauge voting power and governance voting power from a basket of Burnt Hermes. This ratio can only increase over time, supported by the revenue generated through [**Maia Boosted Strategies**](/protocols/overview/tokenomics/strategies).
