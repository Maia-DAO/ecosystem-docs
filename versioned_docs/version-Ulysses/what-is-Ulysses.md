:::warning Ulysses Protocol Deprecated - Withdraw Only

**Ulysses Protocol has been deprecated in favor of native cross-chain standards. Only withdrawals are supported.**

Since Ulysses launched, the Maia Ecosystem has shipped and matured the **Meta-Bridge**, a native cross-chain product supporting modern token standards and protocol-owned bridging flows. The broader cross-chain market has consolidated around sovereign, native standards (such as **LayerZero OFTs** and **xERC20s**) that allow protocols to retain full control over their assets, messaging, and upgrade paths.

Because the Meta-Bridge already fulfills this role natively and is fully supported by existing UI and incentives, continuing to direct resources toward Ulysses is no longer the most efficient use of protocol resources.

**If you have funds in Ulysses, please withdraw them:**

- **[Ulysses Withdraw](https://app.maiadao.io/ulysses/withdraw)** - Withdraw from Ulysses pools
- **[Virtual Account Withdraw](https://app.maiadao.io/virtual/withdraw)** - Withdraw from Virtual Accounts

The protocol remains fully live (it cannot be paused), but Hermes gauges connected to Ulysses have been deprecated and active development has been discontinued.

For support, join the [Maia DAO Discord](https://discord.gg/maiadao).

Welcome to Ulysses Protocol 👋

**Ulysses Protocol** is a decentralized and permissionless 'Omnichain Liquidity Protocol' owned by the community. Our innovative solution is designed to tackle the challenges presented by an increasingly fragmented liquidity landscape in DeFi, ensuring seamless interoperability and capital efficient cross-chain asset deployment.

## Key Features:

1. **Mitigating Market Solution Drawbacks:**
   Ulysses Protocol addresses the shortcomings of current market solutions by implementing a novel design approach. One notable example is the adoption of a synchronous or sequential filling mechanism, avoiding parallel executions. This specific architectural choice contributes to mitigate the negative effects associated with price fluctuations across networks and enhances the overall stability of cross-chain liquidity provision.

2. **Cross-Chain Revenue Generation:**
   Liquidity Providers can now deploy their assets on one chain and participate in revenue-generating activities across multiple chains. Ulysses Protocol enables users to seamlessly tap into opportunities, maximizing their earning potential while minimizing the necessity for additional transactions or intricate maneuvers. This streamlined approach not only enhances user experience but also reduces the overall maintenance burden.

3. **Operational Cost Reduction for DeFi Protocols:**
   DeFi protocols stand to achieve substantial operational cost reductions through Ulysses Protocol. Consolidating liquidity incentives into a unified token eliminates the complexity of managing incentives across different Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and chains. This operational streamlining not only simplifies processes but also boosts the overall efficiency of DeFi protocols.

4. **Permissionless integration of dApps and Tokens to the System:**
   Effortlessly incorporate existing decentralized applications (dApps) and tokens into the omnichain environment with Ulysses Protocol. Protocols and developers can leverage our arbitrary execution features and permissionless factories, eliminating the need for onchain code deployment. This not only reduces development costs and time requirements but also enables smooth interaction with dApps or liquidity across any connected network.

## Overview

Ulysses Protocol has two major components, Virtualized and Unified Liquidity Management. The latter uses Arbitrum's [Balancer's Composable Stable Pools](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/pools/composable-stable.html). Ulysses Unified Liquidity aims to take DeFi one step further by enabling a single token that represents a stable LP of the same token from different chains; this unlocks full composability enabling anyone to use this token as they wish, for example in other AMMs like Uniswap V3, Money Markets like Aave, and so on.

An understanding of the concepts of Ulysses [Ports](./overview/omnichain/ports) and [Virtualized Liquidity](./overview/omnichain/virtual-liquidity) is necessary to fully grasp the mechanics of Ulysses Virtualized Liquidity Management. This is achieved through the use of [Layer0](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/) for cross-chain messaging.
